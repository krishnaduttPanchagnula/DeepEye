## Examples:
<!-- EXMP0 -->
- *products_sample.csv* a simple file with dummy data of random products (+14k lines).
<img src="./Ressources/products-sample.png" width="600">
<!-- EXMP1 -->
- search for all EAN numbers in the csv file which is 12-13 number (universal format) 

**`deepeye ./products_sample.csv -r="[0-9]{12,13}"`**

(all the found 14815 are printed to console here, just cut last part here)
(the prefix `{L:14...}` tell the line number where the match has been found in file)

<img src="./Ressources/rgx-ean.png" width="400">

<!-- EXMP2 -->
- same previous query but print 10 characters around the match (margin 10 characters) using **--range** flag

**`deepeye ./products_sample.csv -r="[0-9]{12,13}" --range=10`**

<img src="./Ressources/rgx-ean-range-10.png" width="400">

<!-- EXMP3 -->
- same previous query but print full line of match using **--range=-1** flag

**`deepeye ./products_sample.csv -r="[0-9]{12,13}" --range=-1`**

<img src="./Ressources/rgx-ean-output-full-line.png" width="700">

<!-- EXMP4 -->
- same previous query but without printing the matched results using the silent flag **`-s`**

**`deepeye ./products_sample.csv -r="[0-9]{12,13}" -s`**
(only stats are printed)

<img src="./Ressources/rgx-ean-silent.png" width="400">
<!-- EXMP5 -->

- search for this random ean and print the full line, as it shows here, this product exists in row number : 14808

**`deepeye ./products_sample.csv -k="book" --range=-1`**

## Features:
- ‚úÖ search with text keyword
- ‚úÖ search with regex expression
- ‚úÖ add option to choose output : full line of match OR match with N chars range around it (`flag:--range`)
- ‚è≥ add option to limit number of lines to output.
- ‚è≥ make the auto update functionality
- ‚úÖ write installer script (need improvements)
- ‚è≥ add queries history option (pick already used queries)

‚úÖ = Ready to use
‚è≥ = In progress

## ToFix:
- :rotating_light: write unit tests!
- ‚è≥ make real fix to use case of `SpotAndMargin(...)` in Regex option to prevent it from running over unmatched regex but same keyword.

üö® = Urgent
